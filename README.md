# IMDb-Movie-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard using Tableau)
## Project Objective
To analyze IMDb movie data and provide visual insights into ratings, genres, directors, certificates, durations, and yearly trends—making it easier for users to explore patterns and make informed entertainment decisions.
## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/Saikhandagale/Tableau_dashboard/blob/main/IMDb_Dataset.csv">IMDb-Movie-Data</a>
## Questions (KPIs) Explored
What are the top 10 movies based on IMDb Rating and MetaScore?

How do IMDb Ratings and MetaScores compare across genres?

What is the average duration of movies by genre and certificate?

Which directors have the highest average IMDb Rating (with at least 2 movies)?

How has the average IMDb Rating changed over the years?

Which genre is most common and how does its average rating compare to others?

Do longer movies tend to have higher IMDb ratings?

Which certificate is associated with higher-rated movies?

Who are the most frequent directors and how do their movies perform?

Which recent movies (2023–2024) have the best ratings?

## Process
Cleaned and formatted the dataset to fix missing or inconsistent values.

Filtered and grouped data by genre, year, certificate, and director for dynamic analysis.

Created calculated fields and parameters to support ranking and trend analysis.

Built a fully interactive Tableau dashboard using bar charts, box plots, scatter plots, line graphs, and filters.

## Project Insights
Directors with multiple high-rated films showed consistent quality (Avg IMDb > 8).

Certain genres like Drama and Biography had higher average IMDb ratings.

"R"-rated and "PG-13" movies had the highest average ratings across the dataset.

A positive correlation was observed between movie duration and IMDb Rating.

Recent (2023–2024) movies show slightly lower ratings on average, possibly due to newer audience dynamics or fewer votes.

## Conclusion
The dashboard helped visualize complex movie rating trends and simplified data exploration.

Filters and interactive elements made it easy for non-technical users to gain insights.

The project enhances storytelling through data and can support studios, critics, and viewers in understanding movie performance.
